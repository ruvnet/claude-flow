**Production-ready multi-agent AI orchestration for Claude Code**

*Deploy 54+ specialized agents in coordinated swarms with self-learning capabilities, fault-tolerant consensus, and enterprise-grade security.*

</div>

## Overview

Claude-Flow is a comprehensive AI agent orchestration framework that transforms Claude Code into a powerful multi-agent development platform. It enables teams to deploy, coordinate, and optimize specialized AI agents working together on complex software engineering tasks.

### Architecture

```
User → MCP Server → Router → Swarm → Agents → Memory → LLM Providers
                       ↑                          ↓
                       └──── Learning Loop ←──────┘
```
### Get Started Fast

``` 
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init 
```

---
### Key Capabilities

🤖 **54+ Specialized Agents** - Ready-to-use AI agents for coding, code review, testing, security audits, documentation, and DevOps. Each agent is optimized for its specific role.

🐝 **Coordinated Agent Teams** - Run unlimited agents simultaneously in organized swarms. Agents spawn sub-workers, communicate, share context, and divide work automatically using hierarchical (queen/workers) or mesh (peer-to-peer) patterns.

🧠 **Learns From Your Workflow** - The system remembers what works. Successful patterns are stored and reused, routing similar tasks to the best-performing agents. Gets smarter over time.

🔌 **Works With Any LLM** - Switch between Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Cohere, or local models like Llama. Automatic failover if one provider is unavailable. Smart routing picks the cheapest option that meets quality requirements.

⚡ **Plugs Into Claude Code** - Native integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Use claude-flow commands directly in your Claude Code sessions with full tool access.

🔒 **Production-Ready Security** - Built-in protection against prompt injection, input validation, path traversal prevention, command injection blocking, and safe credential handling.

🧩 **Extensible Plugin System** - Add custom capabilities with the plugin SDK. Create workers, hooks, providers, and security modules. Share plugins via the decentralized IPFS marketplace.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun 1.0+** (Bun is faster)
- **npm 9+** / **pnpm** / **bun** package manager

**IMPORTANT**: Claude Code must be installed first:

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. (Optional) Skip permissions check for faster setup
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Installation

```bash
# With npm/npx (Node.js)
npm install claude-flow@v3alpha
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init

# With Bun (faster)
bun add claude-flow@v3alpha
bunx claude-flow@v3alpha init

# Run a task with agents
npx claude-flow@v3alpha --agent coder --task "Implement user authentication"

# List available agents
npx claude-flow@v3alpha --list
```

### Claude Code MCP Integration

Add claude-flow as an MCP server for seamless integration:

```bash
# Add claude-flow MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx -y claude-flow@v3alpha

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000
# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
# Restart MCP server
npx claude-flow@v3alpha mcp start
```

**Agent spawn failures**
```bash
# Check available memory
free -m
# Reduce max agents if memory constrained
export CLAUDE_FLOW_MAX_AGENTS=5
```

**Pattern search returning no results**
```bash
# Verify patterns are stored
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks metrics
# Re-run pretraining if empty
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks pretrain
```

**Windows path issues**
```powershell
# Use forward slashes or escape backslashes
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "./data"
# Or use absolute path
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "C:/Users/name/claude-flow/data"
```

**Permission denied errors**
```bash
# Fix npm permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
# Or use nvm to manage Node.js
```

**High memory usage**
```bash
# Enable garbage collection
node --expose-gc node_modules/.bin/claude-flow
# Reduce HNSW parameters for lower memory
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_M=8
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_EF=100
```

## Migration Guide (V2 → V3)

### Breaking Changes

1. **Module Structure**: V3 uses scoped packages (`@claude-flow/*`)
2. **Memory Backend**: Default changed from JSON to AgentDB with HNSW
3. **Hooks System**: New ReasoningBank replaces basic pattern storage
4. **Security**: Stricter input validation enabled by default

### Upgrade Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup existing data
cp -r ./data ./data-backup-v2

# 2. Update to V3
npm install claude-flow@latest

# 3. Run migration
npx claude-flow@v3alpha migrate --from v2

# 4. Verify installation
npx claude-flow@v3alpha --version
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks metrics
```

### Configuration Changes

```bash
# V2 (deprecated)
npx claude-flow init --mode basic

# V3 (new)
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks pretrain  # Bootstrap learning
```

### API Changes

| V2 API | V3 API |
|--------|--------|
| `claude-flow start` | `claude-flow mcp start` |
| `--pattern-store` | `--memory-backend agentdb` |
| `hooks record` | `hooks post-edit --success` |
