# Module Boundary Refactoring Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Module Refactoring Plan
- Documented current module structure and issues
- Designed clear dependency hierarchy
- Defined module contracts and boundaries
- Created implementation roadmap
- Stored plan in Memory with key: `swarm-auto-hierarchical-1751162798153/module-lead/boundaries`

### 2. Created Missing Barrel Exports
- **Core Module** (`/src/core/index.ts`): Exports for Orchestrator, EventBus, Logger, JSONPersistence
- **Agents Module** (`/src/agents/index.ts`): Exports for AgentManager, AgentRegistry
- **Migration Module** (`/src/migration/index.ts`): Replaced CLI implementation with proper exports
- **Memory Module** (`/src/memory/index.ts`): Created comprehensive exports for all memory components

### 3. Fixed MCP Module Implementation
- Extracted factory and utility code from `index.ts` to `mcp-factory.ts`
- Cleaned up barrel export to only export, not implement
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 4. Created Facade Patterns
- **SwarmFacade** (`/src/coordination/facades/swarm-facade.ts`): Clean interface for swarm operations
- **MemoryFacade** (`/src/memory/facades/memory-facade.ts`): Simplified memory operations interface
- Updated module exports to include facades

### 5. Fixed Module Boundary Violations
- Updated CLI swarm command to use facades instead of direct imports
- Removed cross-module internal dependencies
- Established proper abstraction layers

### 6. Identified Circular Dependencies
Found 4 circular dependencies in CLI module:
- `cli/cli-core.ts > cli/commands/index.ts`
- `cli/cli-core.ts > cli/commands/index.ts > cli/commands/enterprise.ts`
- `cli/cli-core.ts > cli/commands/index.ts > cli/commands/sparc.ts`
- `cli/cli-core.ts > cli/commands/index.ts > cli/commands/swarm.ts`

Root cause: Dynamic import in cli-core.ts and static imports in commands/index.ts

### 7. Started Fixing Circular Dependencies
- Created `/src/cli/types.ts` to extract shared type definitions
- This will break the circular dependency chain

## Module Architecture Improvements

### Clear Dependency Hierarchy
```
Types → Utils → Core Services → Business Logic → Features → Enterprise → CLI
```

### Key Principles Applied
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear purpose
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level details
3. **Interface Segregation**: Facades provide focused interfaces
4. **Open/Closed**: Modules are open for extension but closed for modification

### Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced coupling between modules
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Better code organization
- Improved type safety

## Remaining Work
1. Complete circular dependency fixes in CLI module
2. Update remaining CLI commands to use proper module boundaries
3. Add comprehensive module documentation
4. Consider creating additional facades for other modules
5. Implement dependency injection for better testability
