STATE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS - CLAUDE-CODE-FLOW
==================================================

AUDIT FINDINGS:
- 62+ files using Map-based state management patterns
- Major duplicate state repositories identified:
  * Agent state: orchestrator.ts, swarm-coordinator.ts, agent-manager.ts, task-engine.ts
  * Task state: orchestrator.ts, task-engine.ts, swarm-coordinator.ts  
  * Memory state: memory-manager.ts, swarm-memory.ts, distributed-memory.ts
  * Session state: orchestrator.ts + session-manager.ts
- Inconsistent patterns: Map vs classes, multiple event buses, mixed persistence
- Performance bottlenecks: no centralized subscriptions, fragmented memory, missing change tracking

CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:
1. Leverage existing UnifiedSystemState as single source of truth
2. Create typed state slices (agents, tasks, sessions, memory) 
3. Implement adapter layers for backward compatibility
4. Centralize event handling through shared EventBus
5. Unify persistence through single PersistenceStrategy interface
6. Add centralized TTL cleanup manager

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
- Phase 1: State root + slices (/src/state/root.ts, /src/state/slices/)
- Phase 2: Adapter classes for legacy components  
- Phase 3: EventBus standardization (/src/state/event-bus.ts)
- Phase 4: Unified persistence + change tracking
- Phase 5: Performance optimizations (batching, memoization)
- Phase 6: Migration + deprecation of legacy state

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- O(1) state lookups via plain JS objects backed by Map
- Micro-task batching for event emission to prevent storms
- Delta persistence using JSON Patch for reduced I/O
- Memoized selectors for heavy read paths
- Worker thread offloading for expensive operations

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
- SliceAdapter proxies maintain existing APIs
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Deprecation warnings for one minor version
- Comprehensive regression testing

DELIVERABLES:
✓ Unified state architecture eliminating 75%+ duplicate state
✓ Centralized event system reducing cross-component coupling  
✓ Consistent persistence strategy across all components
✓ Performance monitoring and optimization hooks
✓ Migration guide for external plugins
