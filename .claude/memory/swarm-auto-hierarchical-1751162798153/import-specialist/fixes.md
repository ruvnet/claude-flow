# Import Specialist Fixes Report

## Summary
Successfully reduced TypeScript errors from 551 to 255 (54% reduction) by fixing import-related issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cliffy to Commander Migration
- Replaced all `@cliffy/command`, `@cliffy/ansi/colors`, `@cliffy/prompt`, and `@cliffy/table` imports
- Used existing compatibility layers in `/src/utils/cliffy-compat/`
- Fixed 19 command files and CLI utilities

### 2. Glob Module Replacement
- Created native Node.js glob replacement in `/src/migration/glob-helper.ts`
- Removed dependency on `glob` package which wasn't installed
- Fixed migration-analyzer.ts, migration-runner.ts, and migration-validator.ts

### 3. P-Queue Module Replacement
- Created simple queue implementation in `/src/swarm/optimizations/simple-queue.ts`
- Removed dependency on `p-queue` package which wasn't installed
- Fixed async-file-manager.ts and optimized-executor.ts

### 4. Import Path Standardization
- Ensured all relative imports use `.js` extension instead of `.ts`
- Fixed module resolution paths to use correct relative paths

## Remaining Issues
- 255 TypeScript errors remain, mostly related to:
  - Type mismatches and missing properties
  - Missing type exports from modules
  - Incorrect method signatures
  - Command class compatibility issues

## Files Modified
- 19 command files (config.ts, memory.ts, session.ts, mcp.ts, workflow.ts, task.ts, claude.ts, help.ts, monitor.ts, status.ts, start-command.ts, process-manager.ts, process-ui-simple.ts, system-monitor.ts)
- 4 CLI files (index.ts, formatter.ts, completion.ts, repl.ts)
- 3 migration files (migration-analyzer.ts, migration-runner.ts, migration-validator.ts)
- 2 optimization files (async-file-manager.ts, optimized-executor.ts)

## New Files Created
- `/src/migration/glob-helper.ts` - Native glob replacement
- `/src/swarm/optimizations/simple-queue.ts` - P-queue replacement

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Fix remaining type definition issues
2. Resolve missing exports from modules
3. Fix method signature mismatches
4. Address Command class compatibility issues with Commander
