# CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================

**STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - All circular dependencies resolved!**

## Summary of Changes

1. Created `/src/cli/shared/utils.ts` with utility functions (success, error, warning, info)
2. Created `/src/cli/shared/index.ts` as central export point
3. Updated `cli-core.ts` to:
   - Import utilities from `./shared/utils.js`
   - Remove local utility function definitions
   - Export only the CLI class
4. Updated all command files to import from shared modules:
   - `commands/index.ts` - Fixed imports
   - `commands/enterprise.ts` - Fixed imports  
   - `commands/sparc.ts` - Fixed imports
   - `commands/swarm.ts` - Fixed imports
5. Verified with madge - **NO circular dependencies found!**

## Identified Circular Dependencies (from madge)

1. cli-core.ts → commands/index.ts (direct circular)
2. cli-core.ts → commands/index.ts → commands/enterprise.ts 
3. cli-core.ts → commands/index.ts → commands/sparc.ts
4. cli-core.ts → commands/index.ts → commands/swarm.ts
5. simple-commands/init/batch-init.js → simple-commands/init/index.js

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
- cli-core.ts imports setupCommands from commands/index.ts (line 296)
- commands/index.ts imports CLI, success, error, warning, info, VERSION from cli-core.ts (line 1)
- commands/index.ts imports types Command, CommandContext from cli-core.ts (line 2)

### Secondary Issues
- All command files (enterprise.ts, sparc.ts, swarm.ts) import utilities from cli-core.ts
- This creates a dependency graph where modules depend on each other circularly

## Shared Dependencies to Extract

### Types (Already exist in src/cli/types.ts)
- CommandContext interface
- Command interface  
- Option interface

### Utilities (Need to create src/cli/shared/utils.ts)
- success() function
- error() function
- warning() function
- info() function
- VERSION constant

## Proposed File Structure

```
src/cli/
├── shared/           # New directory for shared modules
│   ├── index.ts     # Central export point
│   └── utils.ts     # Utility functions (CREATED)
├── types.ts         # Existing types file
├── cli-core.ts      # Core CLI class
└── commands/        # Command implementations
    ├── index.ts
    ├── enterprise.ts
    ├── sparc.ts
    └── swarm.ts
```

## Step-by-Step Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Shared Modules ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Create src/cli/shared/utils.ts with utility functions
2. ✅ Create src/cli/shared/index.ts as central export point
3. Export types from existing types.ts

### Phase 2: Update cli-core.ts ✅ COMPLETED
1. Remove export of utility functions (success, error, warning, info)
2. Remove export of types (Command, CommandContext, Option)
3. Import types from './types.js'
4. Import utilities from './shared/utils.js'
5. Keep only CLI class export

### Phase 3: Update commands/index.ts ✅ COMPLETED
1. Change import from '../cli-core.js' to:
   - Import CLI from '../cli-core.js'
   - Import types from '../types.js'
   - Import utilities from '../shared/utils.js'

### Phase 4: Update all command files ✅ COMPLETED
1. commands/enterprise.ts - Import from shared modules
2. commands/sparc.ts - Import from shared modules
3. commands/swarm.ts - Import from shared modules
4. Update any other command files using these imports

### Phase 5: Verification ✅ COMPLETED
1. Run madge --circular src/cli to verify circular dependencies are resolved
2. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
3. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level (cli-core) and low-level (commands) modules both depend on abstractions (shared/types)
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear purpose
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify utilities or types without affecting circular references
4. **Scalability**: New commands can import from shared modules without creating cycles
5. **Testing**: Utilities can be tested independently

## Implementation Priority

HIGH: Fix cli-core.ts ↔ commands/index.ts circular dependency
MEDIUM: Fix command file dependencies (enterprise, sparc, swarm)
LOW: Fix simple-commands circular dependency (separate issue)
