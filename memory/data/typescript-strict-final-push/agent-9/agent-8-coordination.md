# Agent 9 → Agent 8 Coordination Report

## Mission Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Agent 9: Bracket Notation Specialist** has successfully eliminated all TS4111 index signature errors in the assigned scope.

## Scope Completed
- **Target**: `src/coordination/**/*.ts` and `src/core/**/*.ts`
- **Files Analyzed**: 33 TypeScript files
- **Errors Fixed**: 1 TS4111 error in `src/coordination/work-stealing.ts`
- **Verification**: 0 TS4111 errors remain in assigned directories

## Specific Fix Applied
```typescript
// Line 208 in src/coordination/work-stealing.ts
// BEFORE:
(stats.workloads as Record<string, unknown>)[agentId] = {

// AFTER:
(stats['workloads'] as Record<string, unknown>)[agentId] = {
```

## Coordination Notes for Agent 8
- **Scope boundaries respected**: Agent 9 did not touch files outside src/coordination and src/core
- **No conflicts expected**: Single targeted fix, no cross-file dependencies affected
- **Remaining work**: TS4111 errors in cli/, memory/, and services/ directories are outside Agent 9's scope
- **Tool used**: Manual code inspection and editing (scripts/fix-bracket-notation.ts was not needed for this single fix)

## Verification Command
```bash
# Verify no TS4111 errors remain in Agent 9's scope:
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep "TS4111" | grep -E "src/(coordination|core)/"
# Returns: 0 results (no errors)
```

## Handoff Status
Agent 9's mission is complete. Ready for Agent 8 to proceed with any remaining coordination tasks.
